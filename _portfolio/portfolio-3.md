Neuronal activity generates high-dimensional datasets, different patterns can reflect distinct functional components. Complex response dynamics raises significant analytical challenges, making pattern recognition methods important. Dimensionality reduction techniques—including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)—are widely employed for this purpose, offering perspectives to find contributing factors within high-dimensional neural signals.


These methods are necessary for feature extraction and property identification, functionally relevant patterns often reside in distinct subspaces.

Modern advancements in pattern recognition and manifold learning are now powerful enough to detect nonlinear relationships within intricate neural response sequences, even in the presence of noise or temporal variability.
