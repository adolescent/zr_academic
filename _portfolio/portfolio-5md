My thesis investigates spontaneous neuronal activity in primary (V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortices. Population-level recordings are critical for reveal the organizational principles underlying spontaneous activity. At the single-cell level, spontaneous activity seems to be randon, however, population analyses shows global synchronization. Notably, stimulus-evoked activity patterns recur spontaneously, even in the absence of external input.

*Spontaneous activity of single neurons seems to be random.*

*Global synchronization and stimulus-evoked patterns recur can be find in spontaneous activity.*    

Nearby neurons (within 200–300 μm) and neurons with similar tuning properties tend to coactivate during spontaneous activity, indicating the importance of horizontal intracortical connections.

*Nearby and similar-tuned neurons have higher correlation in spontaneous activation*
