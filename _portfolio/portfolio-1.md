Two-photon imaging in macaques, while technically challenging, remains feasible. By adapting and refining the protocol established by Li et al. (2017), we successfully performed two-photon imaging in our experiments.

*Imaging sites in one chamber*

This approach enabled longitudinal data collection, with multiple imaging sites accessible through a single optical chamber, which we maintained under stable conditions for several months.

*Quality of imaging remains stable for months*


The technique is capable of simultaneous recording of neuron populations with precise spatial resolution, providing a powerful tool for mapping neural activity in vivo.
