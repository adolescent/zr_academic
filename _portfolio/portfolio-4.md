*This graph shows power spectra of neurons during anesthesia metabolize*    

Neuronal responses exhibit frequency-specific power distributions that correlate with distinct neural processes, making power spectrum analysis important.
Shifts in spectral features are significant during transitions between brain states (e.g., different anesthetized conditions), providing a indicator of neural dynamics under varying physiological contexts.

Based on spectral profiles, advanced analytical tools like phase-locking analysis can reveal correlations between brain regions. These methods reveal functional connectivity patterns by quantifying synchronized activity across neural populations.
