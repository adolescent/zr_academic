Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging (ISOI) is a classical neuroimaging technique that maps functional cortical domains by detecting blood-oxygen variations. This method is easy-to-perform, highly robust, and capable of capturing large-scale cortical activity, making it ideal for investigating functional organization in visual areas such as V1, V2, V4, and even the inferotemporal cortex (IT).

Critically, the functional maps obtained from ISOI can be aligned with results obtained via two-photon imaging, validating its reliability for studying spatial organization.
